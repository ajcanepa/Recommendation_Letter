\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I am pleased to write a letter of recommendation for Liviu Viorel Jula Vacar, who has applied for a position at European Space Agency.

Due to my position as Coordinator of the Computer Science Degree at the University of Burgos I have known to the candidate, Liviu Viorel Jula Vacar, for the past years as he has taken his studies in the Computer Science Engineering Degree of the previously mentioned university. After the degree, he studied the inter-university Master on Business Intelligence and Big Data in Cyber-Secure Environments. 
His dedication and steadfastness in carrying out his studies have been remarkable and he has been one of the most outstanding students of the year.
I had the pleasure of being the supervisor of his final master project entitled \textit{Open-source tool for social networks sentiment analysis} which was rated with distinction at July 2023. The work presented was extraordinary in technique and scientific quality.

The interest of the student in Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence has been a constant in all his university studies, included the aforementioned final master work which helped him to delve deeply in Machine Learning techniques and Big Data technologies.

Nowadays, he is working as researcher in the Computer Engineering Department of Burgos University. The job is financed through the Junta de Castilla y Le\'on (JCyL) under project BU055P20 (JCyL/FEDER, UE) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under project PID2020-119894GB-I00.
He is currently working on Machine Learning related tasks, more specifically in semi-supervised learning.

Liviu Viorel Jula Vacar is well prepared to grow from challenges that he is presented with. His responsibility, efficiency, and programming skills, prepare him beautifully for the work opportunities that ESA offers. For all these motivations, I highly recommend him for the job at European Space Agency.


\closing{Yours sincerely,}
